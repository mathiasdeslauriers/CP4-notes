		<p class="general"> 
		Mountain Biking is a sport that is often of described as a drug. The reason why that is is because its a sport
		that will hook you and you will end up spending all of your money on bikes. The formula for owned bikes is n + 1. 
		Where n is the number of bikes you currently own. While that is an up and coming sport, theres a lot of places where you can do it.
		many mountains are seeing it as a summer revenue so its available in Whistler for example. 
		Mountain biking is EXTREMELY expensive. One of the most expensive sports out there. The reason being is the price of bikes these day.
		I have a three grand car and my bike is 11 grand. I have composed a list of the best bikes for the kit that they offer. Also,
		I've done the same with dropper posts.

		<p class="why">
		<br></br>
		<br></br>
		When I say that bikes are expensive, i mean they really are! Take a look at this one right here. Nice right?
		Most people are suprised when i tell them that the price of is 10,799 dollars USD.
		It could be seen at the Bently of the trails. Manufactures own the Monopoly so they can drive up the price.
		This is why I made a list of bikes that are "worth it for their price".
