		<h3 class =subtitle>What is a Dropper Post?<h3>
		<p class = "dropper post definition">
		dropper posts have become very popular in the world of mountain biking recently. These usefull little devices allow you to push a button on your handle bars,
		and your seatpost will go up or down. This is useful when you are quicly changing from uphill to downhill. Having your seat out of the way
		allows you to move your seat out of the way. This will in turn, cause you to have a greater control during your descents.</br>
		Problem is that these devices will often set you back around 450$.</br>
		This is why I have composed a list of dropper posts that are worth their price.

<!--These are the different dropper posts-->
		<p>
			The only noteworthy dropper posts are the KS Lev integra and the thompson elite. The KS lev integra is really reliable and is good. The thompson elite costs more, but is still reliable and is more reactive.
