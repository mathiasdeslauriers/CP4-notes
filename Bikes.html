			Bikes.. What can I say? they're way too expensive, they take a lot of maintenance. Then again, they're fun. You will most likely end up spending thousands of dollars on  parts 
			or a brand new spankin' bike. Have fun. This is the list that i think can make you make your decision making easier.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Hardtail Bikes</h4>
			<p>
			These bikes are fun, poppy, and the cheaper of the categories. Thes are usually beginner bikes, but it doesnt mean that you cant go hard or fat on these.
			Having no shockadds a challenge, and these bikes are dialed for tricks.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Enduro/All Mountain.</h5>
			<p>
			If you want a bike that can do everything, like climbs, descents on downhill tails, look no further. These bikes are more comfortable because they have a shock and they can take bigger impacts.
			</p>
			
			<h6>Downhill</h6>
			<p>
			These bikes are made to go fast downhill. Beware, they suck at climbing. They have a geometry that makes it impossible for you to get your weight in front of that tire in those climbs.
			They are meant to take heavy impacts and will nearly never break on you.
			</p>
			
			<h7>Dirt Jump/Slopestyle</h7>
			<p>
			Dirt jump bikes and Slope style bikes are made for one thing, jumps and tricks. they have a small frame that helps you move the bike around in the air.
