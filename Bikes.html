			Bikes.. What can I say? they're way too expensive, they take a lot of maintenance. Then again, they're fun. You will most likely end up spending thousands of dollars on  parts 
			or a brand new spankin' bike. Have fun. This is the list that i think can make you make your decision making easier.

			<h3>Enduro/All Mountain.</h3>
			<p>
			If you want a bike that can do everything, like climbs, descents on downhill tails, look no further. These bikes are more comfortable because they have a shock and they can take bigger impacts.

			<td>Specialized Enduro 27.5</td>
			<td><img src = "http://i66.tinypic.com/2it3803.jpg"style = "width:38%"</td>
			<td>This bike has a Sram GX 1 x 11 speed derailleur. Its very good for the price. <br />
				It has a 170 mm Yari RC fork. This is a good for, pleanty of support, but its nothing like the Lyric which is much better.<br />
				It has a rockshox monarch plus Very good with adjustable compression, air, and rebound. It is a piggy shock, meaning that there is an extra air canister.<br />
				For this price i am happy to see a capable dropper post.<br />
				It is an all rounder good bike.<br />

			<td><img src = "https://flowmountainbike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Norco-Range-A3-3122.jpg"style = "width:38%"></td>
			<td>This bike has pretty good value for the spec especially if you live in a country where our money is worth less<br />
				It has a Rockshox Deluxe RT with debponair. It allows for 140 mm of travel<br />
				It has a Rockshox revelation RC with 150mm of travel. It isnt the best fork out there, but its not horrible.<br />
				Im happy enough with the Sram NX 1 x 11. It provides smooth shifting.<br />
				Again very happy to have a dropper post<br />

			<td>This bike has by far the best value for the money<br />
				Its the only bike with Fox suspension, which i like a lot.<br />
				This bike has very capable brakes with the Guide Brakes.<br />
				The Maxxis High rollers are very capable, and are great in wet or dry weather.<br />
			<td>3200$ USD</td>

			<tr>
			<td>Giant Reign 2</td>
			<td><img src = "http://i66.tinypic.com/2it3803.jpg"style = "width:38%"></td>
			<td>For me this is the bike with the less value for the spec in the list.<br />
				This bike has a rockshox  shock like the others. But is doesnt have a debonair. Its less performant<br />
				The Shimano Deore 1x 10 has less range from the rest of the bikes. Its shifting isnt as smooth.<br />
				The Shimano deore hydrolic brakes leave to desir. They arent as responsive as the rest.<br />
				Im happy that theyve decide to put the dropper post on this bike, but i wish that you were able to change the size.<br />
			<td>3300$</td>

			<h3>Hardtail Bikes</h3>
			<p>
			These bikes are fun, poppy, and the cheaper of the categories. Thes are usually beginner bikes, but it doesnt mean that you cant go hard or fat on these.
			Having no shockadds a challenge, and these bikes are dialed for tricks.

			<td>This bike is very expensive for a hardtail. But i put it in this list because its so good!<br />
				The suspension alone is 1000$. Its good, provides good support, and will never break on you.<br />
				The sram NX 1 x 11 speed drivetrain is very good as seen in previous bikes. it has smooth shifting. At this price however, it should be better<br />
				The maxxis Minion tires are good in all trail conditions and are heavy duty.The plus tires help a lot.<br />

			<h3>Downhill</h3>
			<p>
			These bikes are made to go fast downhill. Beware, they suck at climbing. They have a geometry that makes it impossible for you to get your weight in front of that tire in those climbs.
			They are meant to take heavy impacts and will nearly never break on you.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Dirt Jump/Slopestyle</h3>
			<p>
			Dirt jump bikes and Slope style bikes are made for one thing, jumps and tricks. they have a small frame that helps you move the bike around in the air.
